## Sprint 2 State
- Sprint 2 P0 is two-part: (1) real WeCom auth acceptance, (2) frontend fallback-risk tightening in real-login mode
- Sprint 2 acceptance criteria frozen in `docs/tech-lead-sprint2-source-of-truth-2026-03-12.md`
- Backend auth contract: stub/integration PASS; real WeCom E2E still pending environment-backed acceptance
- Frontend: still has hybrid API + fallback paths that can mask integration failures

## Blockers
- No code-level blockers currently known
- Real WeCom E2E acceptance pending: needs real WeCom environment + 3 test identities (employee, manager, operation manager)
- `docs/tech-lead-sprint2-source-of-truth-2026-03-12.md` is the current single source of truth

## Server Status
- ✅ **atlas-server is UP** — :3100 responding via `node src/app.js`
- Backend health route: `GET /health` → `{"code":0,"message":"ok","data":{"status":"ok","service":"atlas-server"}}`
- ⚠️ **Docker services are GONE** — PostgreSQL and Redis containers absent from `docker ps`
  - `openclaw-mission-control-db-1` (PostgreSQL 16-alpine): not present
  - `openclaw-mission-control-redis-1` (Redis 7-alpine): not present
  - Only `searxng` container currently running on :8080
- Backend is mock-mvp-auth-signed backend, not via docker compose
